         <p>My name is Rebekah Kozinski, but you can call me, "Bekah." It's great to meet you! This webpage will tell you a little bit about me and my journey.
            
            I'm 28 years old living in St. Louis, MO currently working as a gastrointestinal clinc nurse. I've been a nurse for 6 years in various fields, and gradauted with my Bachelors of Science in Nursing from Southern Illinois University Edwardsville (SIUE) in 2018.
            I've worked as a labor and delivery nurse, an infertility nurse, a surgical nurse, and now a GI nurse!
            Prior to becoming a nurse I was a full-time student at SIUE and the recipient of the Meridian Scholarship.
            I have many hobbies including painting, playing musical instruments (ukulele, base guilatr, and saxophone), making cocktails, traveling, hanging out with friends and family, dancing, and more.
            I am married to my incredible husband, Ezekiel, and we have a dog named Fernando. He's a cute, labradoodle who loves to play with tennis balls and go on walks.
            My husband and I enjoy traveling, bachata dancing, organizing parties, and playing board games with friends. We have been together for 8 years with many more to come!
            
            My most recent venture is into the world of coding and web development. I am currently a student in LaunchCode's LC101 program. I hope to graduate from this program in 2025 and begin a new career-path.
            Learning to code hasn't been easy, but I am excited to coontinue this journey and learn all that I can!
            Be sure to check out my resume or github account linked at the top for additional information.
            
            Thanks for stopping by!
