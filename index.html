               My name is Rebekah Kozinski, but you can call me, "Bekah." It's great to meet you! This webpage will tell you a little bit about me and my journey.</p>
               
               <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">I'm 28 years old living in St. Louis, MO currently working as a gastrointestinal clinc nurse. I've been a nurse for 6 years in various fields, and gradauted with my Bachelors of Science in Nursing from Southern Illinois University Edwardsville (SIUE) in 2018.
               I've worked as a labor and delivery nurse, an infertility nurse, a surgical nurse, and now a GI nurse!
               Prior to becoming a nurse I was a full-time student at SIUE and the recipient of the Meridian Scholarship.</p>
   
               <p>I have many hobbies including painting, playing musical instruments (ukulele, base guilatr, and saxophone), making cocktails, traveling, hanging out with friends and family, dancing, and more.
               I am married to my incredible husband, Ezekiel, and we have a dog named Fernando. He's a cute, labradoodle who loves to play with tennis balls and go on walks.
               My husband and I enjoy traveling, bachata dancing, organizing parties, and playing board games with friends. We have been together for 8 years with many more to come!</p>
               
               <p>My most recent venture is into the world of coding and web development. I am currently a student in LaunchCode's LC101 program. I hope to graduate from this program in 2025 and begin a new career-path.
               Learning to code hasn't been easy, but I am excited to coontinue this journey and learn all that I can!
               Be sure to check out my resume or github account linked at the top for additional information.</p>
               
               <p>Thanks for stopping by!</p>
